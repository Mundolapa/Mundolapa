A multi-tenant SaaS ecosystem for modern agriculture integrating geospatial data, IoT, and analytics:

| Module | Description |
|:-------|:-------------|
| 🗺️ **Maps** | Geospatial data visualization and field management (PostGIS, drone & satellite data). |
| 🌦️ **Rain Tracker** | Rainfall logging, virtual weather stations, and API integrations (Weatherbit, Meteomatics). |
| 👷 **Field Operations** | Payroll, labor tracking, and resource management. |
| 📊 **Statistics & Insights** | Interactive charts and farm analytics dashboards. |
| 🔒 **Trace Hub** | Immutable traceability for field operations using blockchain-ready architecture. |
| 🤝 **Organization Hub** | Multi-tenant collaboration and map/data sharing between farms and consultants. |

## 🧠 AI & Automation

We are building **AI-driven agricultural intelligence** into the Agromatik ecosystem — combining domain knowledge, data science, and cloud automation to power next-generation tools for precision farming.

### 🌾 Agronomic Assistant (AgroAI)
An intelligent conversational assistant designed to help producers and agronomists make data-informed decisions.
- 💬 **Chat-based interface**: Ask for field recommendations, weather summaries, or NDVI interpretations.  
- 🗣️ **Voice interaction (in development)**: Farmers will soon be able to send voice notes and receive AI responses.  
- 🧠 **Contextual understanding**: Trained on domain-specific knowledge bases, field logs, and crop data.  
- 📈 **Adaptive learning**: Continuously improves from user interactions and verified agronomic insights.  

### 🛰️ Image Intelligence & Crop Diagnostics
Using drone and satellite imagery for early detection and classification of crop stress and diseases.
- 🔍 **Multispectral image analysis**: Processes NDVI, NDRE, OSAVI, and other vegetation indices.  
- 🌱 **AI-based crop classification**: Detects anomalies, pest stress, and irrigation issues from orthomosaics.  
- 📸 **Automated segmentation pipelines**: Converts raw drone imagery into actionable layers in PostGIS.  
- 🧩 **Future vision**: Integration of convolutional models to identify nutrient deficiencies or diseases visually.  

### 🌦️ Predictive Agronomic Models
We design predictive systems that learn from historical weather, soil, and crop yield data.
- ⛅ **Rainfall prediction** and climate pattern forecasting.  
- 🌾 **Yield estimation** based on growth stages and weather inputs.  
- 🐛 **Pest and disease alerts** generated from environmental triggers and local data correlations.  
- ⚙️ **AWS Lambda-based schedulers** generate periodic forecasts and insights for user dashboards.  

### ⚙️ Automation & Cloud Intelligence
We use **serverless architectures and workflow engines** to automate operations and ensure scalability.
- 🧩 **AWS Lambda + SQS + EventBridge** handle asynchronous tasks and background processes.  
- 🧰 **n8n workflows** automate data synchronization, report generation, and email notifications.  
- 🔄 **Automated alerts and triggers** for rainfall updates, new field data, or threshold exceedances.  
- 📡 **Integration-ready microservices** for connecting IoT weather stations, sensors, and external APIs.  

### 🧭 Long-term Vision
Our goal is to create a **unified agronomic intelligence layer** across all Agromatik modules:
- AI agents that collaborate across modules (Rain Tracker, Field Operations, Maps).  
- Dynamic knowledge graphs linking climate, soil, and management data.  
- Continuous model retraining from real-world field feedback.  
- Transparent, explainable AI for decision support — not replacement of human expertise.  

> **Our philosophy:** AI should *assist* agronomists, not replace them — turning data into practical insight while keeping farmers in control of every decision.
